# Deployment-of-ML-for-Gesture-Recognition
Machine learning and computer vision researchers are working on hand gesture recognition for human-computer interaction. Gesture recognition is a technology that reads and interprets motions or gestures as commands using sensors. The device with the capability of gesture recognition can help in multiple real-life applications. It has a broader range of applications, including in the healthcare, educational, and manufacturing sectors, among others. This paper involves a comparative study on Gesture recognition with the help of TinyML.
